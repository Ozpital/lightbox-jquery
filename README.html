<h1 id="lightbox">Lightbox</h1>
<p>An image display script designed with progressive enhancement in mind.</p>
<p><strong>Powered by CSS3 &amp; jQuery</strong></p>

<h3 id="about">About</h3>
<p>This plugin has been made available on GitHub in an attempt to stop myself from re-writing it with every new project that requires a lightbox.</p>
<p>Why do I re-write it everytime? Because I like the challenege of making each incarnation better and more refined but it’s gotten to the point where each build turns out more-or-less identical to the last.</p>
<p><strong>It is a simple script that does exactly what I need it to do.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<p>The main aim of this script is to take a hyperlink that normally forwards to an image file, override that default behaviour using the power of javascript and load the image within a lightbox via ajax.</p>
<p><strong>At it’s most basic all you need to do is insert a data attribute on the hyperlink that points to an image file.</strong></p>
<pre><code>&lt;a href=”image.jpg” data-lightbox&gt;click me to view image&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre><hr>
<h5 id="groups">Groups</h5>
<p>Did you notice there is no value to the ‘data-lightbox’ attribute in the example above?</p>
<p>Without a value with the data-lightbox attribute that image will load as a single image, it won’t interact with any other lightbox links. It will simply open a lightbox and load that single image.</p>
<p>If you would like to open a lightbox with multiple images that the user can change via previous and next buttons then you need to add a group name by adding a value to the data-lightbox attribute.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a href=”image.jpg” data-lightbox=”group1”&gt;click me to view all images in this group&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=”image.jpg” data-lightbox=”group1”&gt;click me to view all images in this group&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre><hr>
